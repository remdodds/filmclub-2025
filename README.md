# 🎬 Film Club

A collaborative film selection app using democratic voting. Members nominate films, vote using a 0-3 scale, and the Condorcet algorithm picks the winner.

**🚀 Status**: Live and deployed on Firebase!
**📦 GitHub**: https://github.com/remdodds/filmclub-2025
**🌐 API**: https://us-central1-filmclubapi.cloudfunctions.net/api

## Overview

Film Club is a SvelteKit + Firebase app that makes choosing your next group film fair and fun:

- **Nominate** - Anyone can add films to the pool
- **Vote** - Score each film 0-3 (I hate it → I love it)
- **Win** - Condorcet voting finds the film that would beat all others head-to-head
- **Watch** - Track your history and never repeat

---

## Features

### Core Functionality
✅ **Democratic Voting** - Condorcet method ensures the fairest winner
✅ **Anonymous Voting** - Visitor IDs track votes without accounts
✅ **Duplicate Prevention** - Fuzzy matching prevents re-nominations

## How It Works

### 1. Setup Your Club
```bash
curl -X POST https://us-central1-filmclubapi.cloudfunctions.net/api/config/setup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "clubName": "Friday Film Club",
    "password": "your-secure-password",
    "timezone": "Europe/London",
    "votingSchedule": {
      "openDay": 5,
      "openTime": "18:00",
      "closeDay": 6,
      "closeTime": "20:00"
    }
  }'
```

**Note**: Club is already configured with:
- Name: "Film Club"
- Password: filmclub2025
- Timezone: Europe/London
- Voting: Friday 18:00 - Saturday 20:00

### 2. Nominate Films
Members add films throughout the week. Duplicates are automatically detected.

### 3. Vote
On Friday at 6pm, voting opens. Everyone rates each film 0-3:
- 0 = "I hate this idea"
- 1 = "Meh, I guess"
- 2 = "Sounds good!"
- 3 = "Yes! Let's watch this!"

### 4. Winner Selected
Saturday at 8pm, voting closes. The Condorcet algorithm picks the winner:
- Compares every film head-to-head
- The film that would beat all others wins
- If no clear winner (cycle), highest total score wins

### 5. Watch & Track
Film is marked as watched, saved to history, removed from nominations.

---

## Voting Algorithm

We use the **Condorcet method** because it's the fairest:

### Example
3 voters, 3 films (A, B, C):

```
Voter 1: A(3), B(2), C(1)
Voter 2: B(3), A(2), C(1)
Voter 3: C(3), B(2), A(1)
```

**Head-to-head comparisons:**
- A vs B: B wins (2 voters prefer B)
- B vs C: B wins (2 voters prefer B)
- A vs C: Tie (1 each)

**Result:** B is the Condorcet winner (beats all others)

### Handling Cycles
If no clear winner exists (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock), we use total score as a tiebreaker.

---

## Development Notes

### Architecture Philosophy
We use **clean separation** between business logic and integration:

- **Business Logic** (pure functions) - Fully tested with unit tests
- **Integration Layer** (Firebase/Express) - Tested via emulators

This means:
✅ Tests track your app's functionality, not library behavior
✅ Easy to maintain and refactor
✅ High confidence in correctness

### Test Coverage
- 27 tests - Auth business logic
- 21 tests - Voting algorithm
- 41 tests - Film nomination logic
- 3 tests - Integration layer

See `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` for detailed test documentation.

## Deployment

### Automated Deployment (GitHub Actions)

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous deployment. Every push to `main` automatically deploys to Firebase.

**Setup** (already configured):
1. ✅ Firebase service account key stored in GitHub secrets
2. ✅ Workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
3. ✅ Auto-deploys functions, Firestore rules, and indexes

**To Deploy**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push
```

GitHub Actions will automatically:
- Build TypeScript functions
- Deploy Cloud Functions
- Deploy Firestore rules and indexes

**Monitor Deployments**:
- GitHub Actions: https://github.com/remdodds/filmclub-2025/actions
- Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/filmclubapi

### Manual Deployment (Optional)

If deploying from a computer (not Termux):

```bash
# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy everything
firebase deploy --only functions,firestore:rules,firestore:indexes
```

### Scheduled Functions

Scheduled functions are automatically deployed and configured:
- ✅ `openVoting` - Opens voting every Friday at 18:00 Europe/London
- ✅ `closeVoting` - Closes voting every Saturday at 20:00 Europe/London

Cloud Scheduler automatically manages these based on the cron expressions in `functions/src/index.ts`.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

None needed! Configuration is stored in Firestore via the setup endpoint.

### Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Enable Firestore Database
3. Enable Cloud Functions
4. Enable Hosting
5. Run `firebase init` and select the services above

---

## Troubleshooting

### Functions won't deploy
- Check Node version in `functions/package.json` matches your local version
- Run `cd functions && npm install` to ensure dependencies are current

### Tests failing
- Check you're in the `functions` directory
- Run `npm install` to ensure test dependencies are installed
- Check Jest version compatibility with TypeScript

### Emulators won't start
- Check ports 5001, 8080, 4000, 5173 aren't in use
- Try `firebase emulators:start --project=demo-test`

---

## Contributing

This is a personal/club project, but feel free to fork and adapt for your needs!

### Development Workflow

1. Write tests first (TDD approach)
2. Implement business logic (pure functions)
3. Create integration layer (thin wrappers)
4. Test with Firebase emulators
5. Deploy when ready
